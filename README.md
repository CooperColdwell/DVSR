## 04/17/2023: Dataset is released.
## 04/03/2023: Updated demo scripts.

## Highlights:
+ Multi-view depth video enhancement, no need for camera pose.
+ Large improvement over single-frame SOTA algorithms.
+ Synthetic video depth dataset (45k frames), with diverse environment and dynamic objects (depth, surface normal, RGB, albedo).

## Introduction
Direct time-of-flight (dToF) sensors are promising for next-generation on-device 3D sensing. However, limited by manufacturing capabilities in a compact module, the dToF data has low spatial resolution (e.g., ~20x30 for iPhone dToF), and it requires a super-resolution step before being passed to downstream tasks. In this paper, we solve this super-resolution problem by fusing the low-resolution dToF data with the corresponding high-resolution RGB guidance. Unlike the conventional RGB-guided depth enhancement approaches which perform the fusion in a per-frame manner, we propose the first multi-frame fusion scheme to mitigate the spatial ambiguity resulting from the low-resolution dToF imaging. In addition, dToF sensors provide unique depth histogram information for each local patch, and we incorporate this dToF-specific feature in our network design to further alleviate spatial ambiguity. To evaluate our models on complex dynamic indoor environments and to provide a large-scale dToF sensor dataset, we introduce DyDToF, the first synthetic RGB-dToF video dataset that features dynamic objects and a realistic dToF simulator following the physical imaging process. We believe the methods and dataset are beneficial to a broad community as dToF depth sensing is becoming mainstream on mobile devices.

## Requirements Installation
Our code is based on PyTorch1.12.1+cu113 and [OpenMMLab], and adapted from [MMEditing]. Please run:

    conda create --name dvsr python=3.8 -y
    conda activate dvsr
    pip install scipy pyyaml terminaltables natsort
    pip install torch==1.12.1+cu113 torchvision==0.13.1+cu113 torchaudio==0.12.1 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113 # pytorch
    pip install mmcv-full==1.7.0 -f https://download.openmmlab.com/mmcv/dist/cu113/torch1.12/index.html # mmcv
    pip install mmsegmentation==0.29.1 # mmseg
    pip install tqdm

[OpenMMLab]: https://github.com/open-mmlab
[MMEditing]: https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmediting

Our pretrained models are in ["chkpts" folder]. We use the pretrained SpyNet from OpenMMLab (stored in ["pretrained" folder]) when training our full network from scratch.

**NOTE**: our pretrained networks only take in scaled depth values between 0-1.

## Demo: Replica Synthetic Data
We generate a RGB-dToF video [sequence] from [Replica Dataset] following the image formation model (Eqn.1 in our paper). Please first download and put into "data/demo_dvsr" folder, then run:

    bash demo_replica.sh
for DVSR (depth video super-resolution) and HVSR (histogram video super-resolution) demo.

Super-resolved depth maps are stored in "results" folder as npy files.

## Demo: DyDToF Dynamitc Synthetic Data
We generate a RGB-dToF video [sequence](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CUBjT7lV5EIAI8PWHPAQQJEgZlahnGtK?usp=sharing) (please first download and put into "data/demo_dydtof" folder) from our [DyDToF Dataset] following the image formation model (Eqn.1 in our paper), with **dynamic objects**. Please run:

    bash demo_dydtof.sh
 DyDToF dataset contains 100 video clips (45k frames). We provide RGB image, depth, albedo image, surface normal and camera trajectory for each video clip. For more information on DyDToF dataset, please refer to this [Readme] file.

## Demo: Apple ARKit Real-world Data
We naively downsample the pre-processed [ARKit dToF data] as input to our DVSR network (please first download and put into "data/demo_arkit" folder). Compared to the high-resolution processing results provided by ARKit, DVSR achieves better temporal consistency and edge sharpness, while also corrects errors in the ARKit preprocessed data. Please run:

    bash demo_arkit.sh
Disclaimer: During training, we assume the dToF data is relatively clean and accurate. When big errors (e.g. completely missing an object) are present in Apple ARKit data, our model can fail.

[ARKit dToF data]: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ntUU6S9UxUQDp8-y2n5vvtSeQd-zq9S1?usp=share_link

Unfortunately, due to privacy policy from the dToF vendor, we can't publish real-world dToF data in this work. Therefore, using the downsampled ARKit dToF data is the best way to evaluate our method on pseudo-real-world data. Please follow "dvsr_arkit.ipynb" to download data from Apple ARKitscenes dataset, and run.

    bash demo_arkit_conf.sh
**You need to change the data and result saving directories accordingly.**

**NOTE: this evaluation only applies to DVSR, not to HVSR**

## Train:
You can use the following command to train the model:

    bash train_scripts/train.sh configs/<CONFIG_FILENAME> #NUM_GPUS
You can modify the training configurations in "configs/dvsr_config.py" or "configs/hvsr_config.py". We recommend to train on 8xGPU.

Previous to training, please first download the [TarTanAir] dataset and put it under "data/tartanair" folder. Please organize the dataset as follows. You can use our train/val [split]
